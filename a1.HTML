<p>  Space exploration utilizes astronomy and space technology to investigate outer space.[1] While the exploration of space
is currently carried out mainly by astronomers with telescopes, its physical exploration is conducted both by uncrewed
robotic space probes and human spaceflight. Space exploration, like its classical form astronomy, is one of the main
sources for space science.</p>
<p>While the observation of objects in space, known as astronomy, predates reliable recorded history, it was the
development of large and relatively efficient rockets during the mid-twentieth century that allowed physical space
exploration to become a reality. Common rationales for exploring space include advancing scientific research, national
prestige, uniting different nations, ensuring the future survival of humanity, and developing military and strategic
advantages against other countries.[2]</p>
